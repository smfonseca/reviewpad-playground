# ReviewPad Playground

This repository is intended for testing and playing around with [ReviewPad](https://reviewpad.com/), a collaborative code review tool. ReviewPad allows multiple developers to review code and leave comments in real-time, making it easier to collaborate on projects and improve code quality.

All the code in the `src` folder is AI generated with the single purpose of testing Reviewpad.
